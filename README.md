# RoboCup Soccer Simulation Tournament Manager

2D Soccer Simulation League is a RoboCup league that simulates a soccer game in a two-dimensional environment. The league is designed for teams of 11 players per team, plus a coach, all of which are autonomous software agents. The simulation is based on a client-server architecture, where the server simulates the game and the clients (teams) send their commands to the server. The server is written in C++ and the clients can be written in any programming language, as long as they can communicate with the server using the specified protocol.

Tourament Manager is a tool that helps to manage the competitions in the 2D Soccer Simulation League. It is a web application that provides a user-friendly interface to create and manage competitions, teams, and matches. The tool is designed to be used by the league's organizers, who can use it to create and manage competitions, as well as by the teams, who can use it to register for competitions and manage their teams.
